# Skript Grammar

The official syntax highlighter for the [Skript](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript) language.

This extension is provided by [SkriptLang](https://skriptlang.org/), the maintainers of the Skript language and will be kept up-to-date with Skript.

## Source & Contributing
This extension is built programmatically from the source [repository](https://github.com/SkriptLang/skript-grammar).
Contributions can be made to the master copy there, which will be synced with every supported code editor.

## Supported Syntax
Highlighting is done according to [these rules](https://github.com/SkriptLang/skript-grammar/blob/main/GRAMMAR.md), to make sure it is reliable and consistent across all official channels.

If you think an element is erroneously highlighted (or missing) you can submit an issue [here](https://github.com/SkriptLang/skript-grammar/issues) or contribute it yourself.
However, please note that:
1. Third-party add-on features are not supported by default (though specific extensions may be available for these.)
2. Highlighting is focused on important words and structures, rather than matching individual syntax.
3. Especially long or unusual lines may not be supported by the specific editor.
